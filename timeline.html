                  At this moment, I am putting a lot of effort into studying and
                  trying to acquire as much knowledge as I can from everything

                  I was under a lot of stress but continued studying on my own
                  as much as I could using platforms like YouTube, Reddit, Stack
                  Overflow, etc., until I made the decision to come to the
                  Netherlands to focus on my studies and have space for
                  myself.<br />

                  At the moment, I am trying to gain more experience and
                  knowledge in the field of networking and web,software and AI
                  development to become an AI full stack developer, and learning
                  different programming languages for different uses in order to
                  be flexible while working <br />

                  I started learning the basics of OOP and began with Python.<br />
                  I used to practice by making mini projects like a simple BMI-
                  and regular calculator.

                  Started with basics like html, css and transitioned into web
                  development.<br />
                  Due to personal problems, I couldn't continue with my studies
                  because I didn't have the time and the equipment to study.<br />
                  However, I kept learning programming on my own through online
                  resources.
